* Concise robust code + comments = clarity (SOSO) * Don’t be afraid to show test cases (SOSO) * Nesting of many methods at once (MT) * String concatenation (MT) * Finding helpful keywords that were probably acquired through research (del, next, etc.) (Team MASS) * F string method: print(f”text {var_name} text.”) (ES) * Can title methods from modules as whatever function name you want: (ES)
	ex)
		from random import randint as r (ES)
 * COOL WAY TO MAKE A LIST WITH RANDOMIZED NUMBERS (ES) 
Instead of creating an empty array and having a for loop that appends integers to it, you can do:  	
	ex)
		arr = [ randint(1,8) for x in range(10) ]
		arr = [ x for x in range(10) ] : [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

* Not using keywords as variable names (Team MASS) * Neat formatting for comment block: creating a table out of characters (Team MASS)
