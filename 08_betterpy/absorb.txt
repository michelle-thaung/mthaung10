0. Concise robust code + comments = clarity (SOSO)
1. Don’t be afraid to show test cases (SOSO)
2. Nesting of many methods at once (MT)
3. String concatenation (MT)
4. Finding helpful keywords that were probably acquired through research (del, next, etc.) (Team MASS)
5. F string method: print(f”text {var_name} text.”) (ES)
6. Can title methods from modules as whatever function name you want: (ES)
	
	ex)
		from random import randint as r (ES)
7. COOL WAY TO MAKE A LIST WITH RANDOMIZED NUMBERS (ES)
Instead of creating an empty array and having a for loop that appends integers to it, you can do:  	
	ex)
		arr = [ randint(1,8) for x in range(10) ]
		arr = [ x for x in range(10) ] : [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

8. Not using keywords as variable names (Team MASS)
9. Neat formatting for comment block: creating a table out of characters (Team MASS)
