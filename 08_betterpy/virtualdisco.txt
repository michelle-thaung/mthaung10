Our source: OUR HERO ZERO ETHAN SHENKER who learned about virtual environments
            from Python documentation and W3Schools that he read over the years

0. The command 

		$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero

		     		aka

		Create a virtual environment (venv) 
        	that is stored in the directory name myherozero

1. Create a virtual environment by using the built-in module titled venv in python3 by
   using the flag -m which means look inside the modules that exist within python3
2. Can access stuff in myherozero even by not activating it but cannot work with it
   
			ex) $ ls 

    			bin include lib pyvenv.cfg

3.  The command

		$ source myherozero/bin/activate 
	
	switches the python environment that you're in to the python version the
        virtual environment is running under 

4. When user is in the virtual environment, command line indicates this by putting
   the virtual environment's directory name at the beginning of the command line
   in parentheses 
			ex) (myherozero) user:~ username$

5. myherozero is a directory that holds the virtual environment which is operating under 
   a certain version of python of your choosing
6. Creating a virtual environment allows you to maintain separate versions of python 
   Which then allow you to maintain separate versions of the same modules within python

			ex) 0. module a v1 exists on your computer
			    1. You then need module a v1 in a project, but you'd like to 
			       update module a v1 to module a v2 on your computer
			    2. Use a virtual environment to maintain v1 for your project
			       while using module a v2 elsewhere on your computer

7. Modules* exist in include directory within the virtual environment. *Modules are
   packages of code that other people have written
