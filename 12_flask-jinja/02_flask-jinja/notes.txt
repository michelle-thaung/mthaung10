A0. Name Error displayed by Flask - name render_template not found

When render_template is replaced and the page for localhost:5000/my_foist_template 
is loaded, the sequence defined in app.py is displayed vertically. 

Initial question: why does each element display on top of one another?
Answer: <br> tag in for loop in model_tmplt.html

A1. Yes.

A2. In observing variable names in model_tmplt.html, such as
foo in the title, or collection for the list being iterated through,
we saw that positional arguments to the render_template function are those
being referenced in the html file.
