Prediction 1:
Table with 2 rows and 3 columns populated with stuff that can be clicked on
When clicked, pop-up will appear on screen

Results 1:
As predicted but missed that the clicked string appears in pop-up

Prediction 2:
Table with 2 rows and 3 columns populated with stuff that can be clicked on
This time, each element in table, row, and table itself can be clicked on
When row clicked pop-up of list with the 3 elements in row
Pop-ups overlaps?
When clicked, pop-up will appear on screen

Results 2:
When on string, all 3 pop-ups appear but from elem, to row, to table
When on table border, only table pop-up (entire html table with tags euck)

Prediction 3:
Table with 2 rows and 3 columns populated with stuff that can be clicked on
This time, each element in table, row, and table itself can be clicked on
e.stopPropagation(); prevents multiple subsequent pop-ups and only causes the "first" thing clicked on to pop

Results 3:
Pop-up of the "highest level" in this case the entire table and not each element

Prediction 4:
Table with 2 rows and 3 columns populated with stuff that can be clicked on
This time, each element in table, row, and table itself can be clicked on
The 3rd argument in .addEventListener() essentially acts as preventDefault() if true
The order does matter

Results 4:
Pop-up of the "highest level" in this case the entire table and not each element
The order DOESN'T MATTER
Pop-up is dictated by the highest level in HTML as opposed to order in JS (event listeners)
